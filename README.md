# Welcome to my **Frontend Mentor Tester**!!!!!!!

Hello, 你好, 안녕하세요, Hola, Hallo, Bonjour!

Why the 7 exclamation points, you ask?

Well, this is my **application project** for **[The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/)**.  I began this project on March 12 and the deadline is March 18, so _7 excited exclamations for 7 days_! ✨

### Deciding on the project 📔

With applications open I could finally see the [application](https://airtable.com/shrv9cqaTVHNhCvT1) requirements.  **React projects are prioritized**. 

Cool... until I do a quick scan of my [Github](https://github.com/JoleneKearse).  I've focused on other things these past couple months, including:
- SvelteKit,
- DSAs,
- Python, and
- Finally **submitting** Frontend Mentor challenges.

And all my React projects are quite old! 

So strange that my _meandering learning_ affected how many React projects I continued doing. 🤣  

Anyway, I decide to do one **awesome-sauce project to showcase my skills**.  

But, what to do?

Well, early, early this morning I listened to the **Self-Taught Devs** podcast featuring one of my favourite **LinkedIn** connections.  She was talking about choosing her _showcase project_ and how she searched through a list of **free API's** for inspiration.

Well, a React project needs dynamic content, at least if you want to use one of it's **super-powers**! 💪 So, yeah, an API...

But, hmmm, which one can I use to solve a problem.  🤔

Lately I've been doing **Frontend Mentor Challenges** to speed up production and reacquaint myself with one of my greatest loves, **CSS**.  ❤️  The given designs always include **mobile** & **desktop** screenshots to imitate.  

I've been using this great **[Chrome extension: Viewport Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/viewport-resizer-%E2%80%93-respon/kapnjjcfcncngkadhpmijlkblpibdcgm?hl=en)**. It gives quick access to Frontend Mentor's **375px width**, but you have to fiddle with the custom desktop width of **1440px**.  Like, it's really not a _big_ deal, but I'd love a tool to _automatically_ flip between these target viewports.

So I was happy to find **[Abstract's Screenshot API](https://app.abstractapi.com/api/screenshot/documentation)**! 💡

I loved this for 3 reasons 💖:
1) Screenshots are so useful for development,
2) You could customize the sizes; and
3) The docs said it'd return clear error codes.

### My journey 🎢

<hr>

#### Day 1 🏁1️⃣

I searched out **free APIs** to use and land on an awesome one I can use in a React project to solve a problem I've encountered - and I'm sure others have as well. 🕺🏼

With an exciting idea & API in tow, I begin...

I start my first couple hours by:
1) _Happily_, remembering (without looking up) how to scaffold a React project using **Vite** and **Yarn** in the **CLI**;
2) Deciding to say _C'est la vie_ and go with the `JavaScript + SWC` option;
3) Starting the *README**; and
4) Holding myself accountable, by posting on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jolene-kearse-2562ba218/)

#### Day 2 🏁2️⃣

Today I cleaned up the boilerplate and worked on the design on the fly!

1) I use **DevTools** to determine the fonts used and add the **Google Fonts** links.
2) Set up site colors using **custom properties**.
3) Create my Header and Footer components.
4) Have quite a time of it remembering how to import SVGs.


#### Day 3 🏁3️⃣

### What I reviewed 📓

- ##### Just how to set up a project 😕

I noticed _just how long_ it had been since I spun up a React project using Vite and Yarn! I had to spend a little bit with my fingers on the keyboard in the CLI, thinking: _"What's that command, again?"_

Thankfully I remembered a time spent coding with my group, where we were joking around about it.

But, yes, `yarn create vite` still works!

Unfortunately, I hate to cheat on...

- ##### Initializing a Github repo

I do remember another fun time, when my three teammates and I tried recalling the exact CLI commands and order to initialize a repo...  Good times! I did have to cheat though, as I got `git remote add origin <SSH key>` in the wrong order, necessitating a second go!

- ##### Writing good commit messages 

In my excitement and haste, I forgot to label my git commits correctly!

[Writing better commit messages](https://medium.com/swlh/writing-better-commit-messages-9b0b6ff60c67)

- ##### Getting correct file paths

I gave myself an unnecessarily hard time importing SVG images, because **I forgot how file paths work**!  🤣  

Initially I used a simple img tag after importing it: 
```jsx
import IconGithub from './assets/icon-github.svg'
...
<img src={IconGithub} alt="" />
```
Unfortunately I got an **error** at the file path.  I checked out some of my prior projects and even went through the options in [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-import-svgs-in-react-and-vite/#:~:text=Importing%20SVGs%20using%20the%20image,supports%20it%20off%20the%20bat.).  

So, yep, research is good, but know what's even better?

Actually reading the error message!

I'd have saved myself about an hour if I'd _really_ considered my file path in the first place.  I know this is one of my trouble spots! 

I was trying to access a file in my `assets` directory from within`/components`, so I needed to come out of one folder, up a level, then back into another, so all I had needed was another period/dot!

![File path with explanation of where I had to navigate to](/screenshots/assets-file-path.png)

Since I've had this issue so many times before, I took the time to remind myself of two things:
1) `.` means the **current directory**, while
2) `..` is the **parent directory**.

### Resources 📑

[The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/) is this super-cool organization offering this opportunity.

[Chrome extension: Viewport Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/viewport-resizer-%E2%80%93-respon/kapnjjcfcncngkadhpmijlkblpibdcgm?hl=en) is the best free resource I had found to quickly test your responsive projects in different device sizes.

[Abstract's Screenshot API](https://app.abstractapi.com/api/screenshot/documentation) shows the (quite good) documentation for my chosen API.

[Writing better commit messages](https://medium.com/swlh/writing-better-commit-messages-9b0b6ff60c67) is a great reminder on commit messages.

[How to Import SVGs in a React and Vite app](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-import-svgs-in-react-and-vite/#:~:text=Importing%20SVGs%20using%20the%20image,supports%20it%20off%20the%20bat.) provides 6 ways to do it.  The first worked in my case - of course I did start in reverse order! 🤣 

[Using the `FileReader` API to preview images in React](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-filereader-api-preview-images-react/) is an easy to understand guide to display user uploaded images to a page.

[How to Measure JavaScript Execution Time](https://dev.to/saranshk/how-to-measure-javascript-execution-time-5h2#:~:text=The%20easiest%20way%20to%20track,the%20difference%20of%20the%20two.) was my introduction to the Console's time methods.

### About me 🤪

Hiya! 👋 My name is **Jolene Kearse**, a Canadian who identifies as a **forever expat**.

I am a 41-old-year old Native American transitioning into tech.  I was an **English as a Foreign Language Teacher** ️🌏🧑‍🏫 for over 15 years - _so, yeah, for a little bit_ 🤌... I lived all over the world, including China, England & South Korea.

Now I'm a proud, **self-taught Software Engineer**!!!

I'm also proud of how far I came in 2022. **I finally learned JavaScript**! 🍻 _I had struggled for about a year before I finally could add that to my skillset. If you're interested in an awesome 🔥 course check out [Class Central's Bootcamp YouTube Playlist going through freeCodeCamp's Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU3RKvMpgrSEoqVIV14K_zuinrIBcnCgT).

Then I met an awesome group of fellow-learning devs, **The Explorers**. This exposed me to the myriad and oft-confusing ways of using **Git** in a team - loving it now! But also projects using so many kinds of tech that would've just blown my mind a year before 🤯 including:

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

I even participated in **[#Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)** and earned the coveted T-shirt! 🎉👕

But who cares about 2022? This is 2023!

...

I've been taking so many courses to learn **Backend Development** and **navigate the process of earning my first tech job**!

One of those courses has seen me going back to **Python** - which I had treated as my _crutch language_ to understand JavaScript. 

_(I hadn't found an engaging JS course at that point and heard how close Python was to natural language.)_

I've been taking a **DSA** course that uses Python, and just had to laugh how things have come full-circle.  I was a bit fuzzy on the teacher's Python code until she translated it to JS for all of us curly braces lovers! 🤣 

Another challenge I am undertaking this year is [Exercism's](https://exercism.org/) **#12in23**. This is a cool 😎 opportunity to try out 12 different languages this year. Each month has a theme, like **Functional February** and **Mechanical March** to encourage you to check out different language paradims. I'm loving this chance to dip my toe in other types of programming.
