# Welcome to my **Frontend Mentor Tester**!!!!!!!

Why 7 exclamation points, you ask?

Well, this is my **application project** for **[The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/)**.  Today is March 12 and the deadline is March 18, so _7 excited exclamations for 7 days_! ✨

### Deciding on the project 📔

Applications open today, and I finally see the [application](https://airtable.com/shrv9cqaTVHNhCvT1).  **React projects are prioritized**. 😱

Cool... until I do a quick scan of my [Github](https://github.com/JoleneKearse).  I've focused on other things these past couple months, including:
- SvelteKit,
- DSAs,
- Python, and
- Finally **submitting** Frontend Mentor challenges.

And all my React projects are quite old! 

So strange that my _meandering learning_ affected how many React projects I continued doing. 🤣  

Anyway, I decide to do one awesome-sauce project to showcase my skills.  

But, what to do?

Well, early, early this morning I listened to the **Self-Taught Devs** podcast featuring one of my favourite **LinkedIn** connections.  She was talking about choosing her _showcase project_ and how she searched through a list of **free API's** for inspiration.

Well, a React project needs dynamic content, at least if you want to use one of it's **super-powers**! 💪 So, yeah, an API...

But, hmmm, which one can I use to solve a problem.  🤔

Lately I've been doing **Frontend Mentor Challenges** to speed up production and reacquaint myself with one of my greatest loves, **CSS**.  ❤️  The given designs always include **mobile** & **desktop** screenshots to imitate.  

I've been using this great **[Chrome extension: Viewport Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/viewport-resizer-%E2%80%93-respon/kapnjjcfcncngkadhpmijlkblpibdcgm?hl=en)**. It gives quick access to Frontend Mentor's **375px width**, but you have to fiddle with the custom desktop width of **1440px**.  Like, it's really not a _big_ deal, but I'd love a tool to _automatically_ flip between these target viewports.

So I was happy to find **[Abstract's Screenshot API](https://app.abstractapi.com/api/screenshot/documentation)**! 💡

I loved this for 3 reasons 💖:
1) Screenshots are so useful for development,
2) You could customize the sizes; and
3) The docs said it'd return clear error codes.

### My journey 🗺️

<hr>

#### Day 1 🏁1️⃣

I searched out **free APIs** to use and land on an awesome one I can use in a React project to solve a problem I've encountered - and I'm sure others have as well. 🕺🏼

With an exciting idea & API in tow, I begin...

I start my first couple hours by:
1) _Happily_, remembering (without looking up) how to scaffold a React project using **Vite** and **Yarn** in the **CLI**;
2) Deciding to say _C'est la vie_ and go with the `JavaScript + SWC` option;
3) Starting the *README**; and
4) Holding myself accountable, by posting on [LinkedIn]()
