# Welcome to my **Frontend Mentor Tester**!!!!!!!

Why 7 exclamation points, you ask?

Well, this is my **application project** for **[The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/)**.  Today is March 12 and the deadline is March 18, so _7 excited exclamations for 7 days_! ✨

### My journey 🗺️

#### Day 1 🏁1️⃣

##### Initial thoughts 🤔

Applications open today, and I finally see the [application](https://airtable.com/shrv9cqaTVHNhCvT1).  **React projects are prioritized**. 😱

Cool... until I do a quick scan of my [Github](https://github.com/JoleneKearse).  I've focused on other things these past couple months, including:
- SvelteKit,
- DSAs,
- Python, and
- Finally submitting **Frontend Mentor** challenges.

And all my React projects are quite old! 

So strange that my _meandering learning_ affected how many React projects I continued doing. 🤣  

Anyway, I decide to do one awesome-sauce project to showcase my skills.  

But, what to do?

Well, early, early this morning I listened to the **Self-Taught Devs** podcast featuring one of my favourite **LinkedIn** connections.  She was talking about choosing her _showcase project_ and how she searched through a list of **free API's** for inspiration.
